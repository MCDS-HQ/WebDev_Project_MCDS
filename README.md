The css for all three pages is included in "CSS"
The media used for the website, namely images, are all included in "Media"
Visible in the main folder, "Email" contains the email that would be sent to the fictional entrepeneur "Lucas Snow". It contains a summary of the website along with some details about the design choice and though process.
