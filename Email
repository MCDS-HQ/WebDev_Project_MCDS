Subject: Three visual impairment aids for Snow Trails Travel Agency website 

Dear Lucas, 

I hope this email finds you well. 

Based on your own disability, we have updated our site proposal with three accessibility aids for those who are visually impaired. 

When adding images to the sight we added alt text to describe the image in detail. This way the browsers screen reader can read the text out to the person. 
We tidied up and improved the headings of the website to make it easier for screen readers to understand the page layout. 
We made the links present on our website much more descriptive, so screen readers know where the links lead and the user know what they are clicking isnâ€™t a suspicious link. 
 

 

 

Please tell us if you have any additional thoughts or if you think we missed a feature you wanted us to include. We appreciate your feedback. 

Best regards,
